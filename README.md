## Introduction
The Boston University Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) is a heterogeneous Linux cluster composed of both Shared and Buy-in components. The system currently includes over 28,000 CPU cores, 400 GPUs, and nearly 14 petabytes of storage for research data.

The SCC is suitable for high-performance computing in a wide range of disciplines, from the physical sciences, engineering, biostatistics, public and global health, bioinformatics, genomics, neuroscience, and geographic information systems (GIS), to emerging computational communities such as machine learning, economics, finance, the social sciences, microbiology, and infectious diseases.
